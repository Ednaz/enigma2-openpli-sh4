enigma2 translations
====================

Enigma2 uses ".po" extension for translations which you can find them
in "po" folder and start translating in your desired language using some tools like https://poedit.net

A PO file is made up of many entries, each entry holding the relation
between an original untranslated string and its corresponding translation.
All entries in a given PO file usually pertain to a single project,
and all translations are expressed in a single target language.

Don't forget that a new language file must be considered in "po/Makefile.am"
as a "po" file is just the source file of a language and it has to be compiled
into a ".mo" file and then you can define it in enigma2 python files as a new language.

How to create updated "po" files including latest strings?

Follow these steps:

1- git clone https://github.com/OpenPLi/enigma2.git
2- Find "configure.ac" file and comment first 4 "PKG_CHECK_MODULES" and "AC_CHECK_LIB" lines using "#".
3- cd enigma2
4- ./autogen.sh
5- ./configure --with-po
6- cd po
7- make *.po

Now in "po" folder you'll find updated ".pot" and all ".po" files.

Hint: A ".pot" file is the template that you can use to create new ".po" files.
